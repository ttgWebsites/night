					<li data-theme="d">Night tells the story of Elie Wiesel's experiences during the holocaust. Wiesel was a teenager when 
					his country was taken over by Nazi's. Wiesel and his family are loaded into cattle cars on trains and sent to the Auschwitz 
					concentration camp. At the camp Elie and his father are separated from Elie's mother and sister. His mother and sister are 
					sent to the gas chambers. Elie and his father face challenges every day and are forced to partake in extremely strenuous 
					and dangerous labor. Both of them witness many atrocities of the camps, some so terrible and horrifying that Elie begins 
					to lose his faith in God. Eventually Elie and his father manage to survive the severe suffering and constant risk of being 
					sent to their deaths for nearly the whole time in the death camps, however before being liberated Elie's father dies. Elie
					makes it out alive but severely weakened and manages to tell his story a few years later in Night.</li>
