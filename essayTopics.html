					<li data-theme="b">How does faith play a role in Elie's experience in the concentration camps?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Growing up Elie was raised by a devout Jewish family, and took on the beliefs himself.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">When Elie is forced to live in a concentration camp and is subject to witness the atrocities that the Nazi's committed on a daily basis he seems to struggle with his faith.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Elie cannot see how a god would allow such horrible things to occur and seems to question his existence.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Elie also witnesses others who have lost all faith in God as they struggle with what they face.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">However Elie does recognize that for many faith in God is an important factor as it is helpful in survival as many of those that have lost all faith seem to have lost the will to live as well.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Though Elie seems to struggle with his faith and he cannot see how any God would allow the holocaust to occur he still manages to hold onto his attachment to God and continues to pray.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">It seems as the limited attachment to his beliefs helps him hold on and survive though his faith is forever changed.</li>

				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">How does chance and luck play a role in Elie's survival of the Holocaust?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Though Elie and many other Jews affected by the Holocaust still had control over some of their actions and moral decisions that were important to how they handled the torture put upon them by the Nazi's for a great deal of them it was merely luck and chance that allowed them to survive.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Throughout the novel Elie points out many of these circumstances that were helpful to his survival and really out of his control.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">He runs into a man outside the concentration camp that gives him advice that forever changes his life; lie about his age.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">This helps him being passed upon in the initial group of people being sent to the gas chambers.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Other various instances he proves extremely lucky as well as many people who seem much stronger and capable of living than him are selected to be put to death while he keeps being afforded the opportunity to live.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">It seems as if for a majority of those who survived the Holocaust it was by hundreds of exact situations going their way.</li>
